🐛 Known Issues

* cardsWon.puch() should be corrected to cardsWon.push()

* cardsChosenIds.puch(cardId) should be corrected to cardsChosenIds.push(cardId)

* In checkMatch(), document.querySelectorAll['img'] should be document.querySelectorAll('img')


Fixing these typos will improve functionality.
